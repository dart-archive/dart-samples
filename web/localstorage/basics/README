Local Storage is a simple key/value storage interface
for Strings. Use Dart's local storage interface as a
Map.

Note, local storage, though widely supported, is a
synchronous API. Because it involves IO, this interface
should not be used for high throughput operations.
You might consider IndexedDB as an alternative.

For simple string keys and values, and as a replacement
for cookies, local storage is useful.
