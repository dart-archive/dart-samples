        To see this example in action, make changes to <code>index.html</code>
        and then reload this page. You'll notice that your changes don't show up
        because we're showing the cached version instead. Next make a change
        such as incrementing the date or version number in
        <code>appcache.mf</code>. Now when you reload this page, you'll be
        prompted to load the new version.
