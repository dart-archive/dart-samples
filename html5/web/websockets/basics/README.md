## WebSockets 101

A simple example of using WebSockets for communication.

You can learn about the basics of WebSockets by reading the
[Introducing WebSockets: Bringing Sockets to the Web](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/)
article on HTML5Rocks.

WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communications channels over a
single TCP connection.

This example opens a WebSocket connection to an echo server
(`ws://echo/websocket.org`), sends data to the server, and then displays the
response on the web page.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/websockets/).
